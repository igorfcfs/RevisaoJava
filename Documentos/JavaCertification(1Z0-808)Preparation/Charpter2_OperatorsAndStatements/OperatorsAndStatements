Numeric Promotion Rules
1. If two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values
to the larger of the two data types.
2. If one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically
promote the integral value to the floating-point value’s data type.
3. Smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time
they’re used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of the operands is
int.
4. After all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting
value will have the same data type as its promoted operands.

Let’s tackle some examples for illustrative purposes:
■ What is the data type of x * y?
int x = 1;
long y = 33;
If we follow the fi rst rule, since one of the values is long and the other is int, and long
is larger than int, then the int value is promoted to a long, and the resulting value is
long.

■ What is the data type of x + y?
double x = 39.21;
float y = 2.1;
This is actually a trick question, as this code will not compile! As you may remember
from Chapter 1, floating-point literals are assumed to be double, unless postfi xed with
an f, as in 2.1f. If the value was set properly to 2.1f, then the promotion would be
similar to the last example, with both operands being promoted to a double, and the
result would be a double value.

■ What is the data type of x / y?
short x = 10;
short y = 3;
In this case, we must apply the third rule, namely that x and y will both be promoted
to int before the operation, resulting in an output of type int. Pay close attention to
the fact that the resulting output is not a short, as we’ll come back to this example in
the upcoming section on assignment operators.

■ What is the data type of x * y / z?
short x = 14;
float y = 13;
double z = 30;
In this case, we must apply all of the rules. First, x will automatically be promoted to
int solely because it is a short and it is being used in an arithmetic binary operation.


int x = (int)1.0;
short y = (short)1921222; // Stored as 20678
Using Additional Binary Operators 61
int z = (int)9f;
long t = 192301398193810323L;


overflow or underflow
The expressions in the previous example now compile, although there’s a cost. The sec-
ond value, 1,921,222, is too large to be stored as a short, so numeric overflow occurs
and it becomes 20,678. Overflow is when a number is so large that it will no longer fit
within the data type, so the system “wraps around” to the next lowest value and counts
up from there. There’s also an analogous underflow, when the number is too low to fit in
the data type.




short x = 10;
short y = 3;
short z = x * y; // DOES NOT COMPILE

short values are automatically promoted to int when applying any arithmetic operator, with the resulting value being of
type int.

short x = 10;
short y = 3;
short z = (short)(x * y)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

long x = 5;
int y = 5;
y = x * y; // DOES NOT COMPILE, because it returns a long value without conver y to long

long x = 5;
int y = 5;
y *= x; // COMPILE, it converts y to long and returns a long value

long x = 5;
long y = (x=3);
System.out.println(x); // Outputs 3
System.out.println(y); // Also, outputs 3

The key here is that (x=3) does two things. First, it sets the value of the variable x to be
3. Second, it returns a value of the assignment, which is also 3. The exam creators are fond
of inserting the assignment operator = in the middle of an expression and using the value of
the assignment as part of a more complex expression.




Be wary of short-circuit behavior on the exam, as questions are known to alter a vari-
able on the right-hand side of the expression that may never be reached. For example, what
is the output of the following code?
int x = 6;
boolean y = (x >= 6) || (++x <= 7);
System.out.println(x);
Because x >= 6 is true, the increment operator on the right-hand side of the expression
is never evaluated, so the output is 6.



The equality operators are used in one of three scenarios:
1. Comparing two numeric primitive types. If the numeric values are of different data
types, the values are automatically promoted as previously described. For example,
5 == 5.00 returns true since the left side is promoted to a double.
2. Comparing two boolean values.
3. Comparing two objects, including null and String values.


File x = new File("myFile.txt");
File y = new File("myFile.txt");
File z = x;
System.out.println(x == y); // Outputs false
System.out.println(x == z); // Outputs true
